Perry!
                    
He's a semi-aquatic egg-layin' mammal of action
(Doo-bee-doo-bee-doo-bah
Doo-bee-doo-bee-doo-bah)
He's a furry little flatfoot who'll never flinch from a fray-ee-ay-ee-ay
He's got more than just mad skill, he's got a beaver tail and bill
(Woah-oh-ahhh, wap-bap)
And the women swoon whenever they hear him say...
(*Platypus chatter*) (*sigh*)
