He's a semiaquatic
Egg laying mammal of action
He's a furry little flatfoot
Who'll never flinch from a fray
He's got more than just mad skill
He's got a beaver tail and bill
And the women swoon
Whenever they hear him say -
He's Perry, Perry the Platypus
(You can call him Agent P)
Perry (I said you can call him Agent P)
Agent P
